# key-sequence-detection
A project where if users input a certain variation of key inputs, a surprise appears!

The variation of keys in this case is just typing out a word, which we will call the "secret code"

The secret code in this case is the word: <b>PRESTO</b>

Type the secret code out while having the index file open for a surprise to appear in the window :)
